    This is an independent consulting project for <a
    href="http://stylelend.com">Stylelend.com</a>. They provide an online
    market place for women to lease out their clothing to other people. The
    problem right now is that you must send your clothes into them to have
    the worth of your clothing evaluated. Who wants to wait that long to
    find out how much your clothing items are worth?

    The model used is a random forest regression. The four main features of the
    regression are brand, item type (dresses, shoes, etc, ...), cost new, and
    description. From the description, obejective adjectives are extracted and compared to a bank of words.

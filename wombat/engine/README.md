# using the parse_sentence.py code

Before you can use the parcse
parse_sentence.py uses the python nltk library. Before you can use this
you have to run

```
import nltk
nltk.download()
```

After that a screen will pop up. I just downloaded everything which
takes up about 2 gigs. If you are on a server you can run the above
download code then hit 'd' (download) and 'all' (for download
everything)
